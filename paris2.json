What a wonderful idea for sunny, warm days of July. I had never seen pictures of it, nor heard that it was done by the city of Paris for the people."

		//     "description": "My wife and I spent a half-day at the Louvre during a 3-day Paris visit. Of course it's a must destination and the collection of art and history is incomparable. My only suggestions and observations to first-time visitors are that Paris was unseasonably warm during our May visit, and the Louvre was at times hot and stuffy. But maybe (maybe!) we're simply spoiled Americans, used to our air conditioning."

		//     "description": "Who could ask for a better honeymoon destination than Paris, The City of Love? We happen to agree with Audrey Hepburn when she said, Paris is always a good idea. Its iconic monuments like the Eiffel Tower, museums like the Louvre and landmarks like the Notre Dame Cathedral are certain to dazzle visitors. However, even more spectacular than the sights is Paris' rich culture found in its charming boulevards, cozy cafes and bustling bistros. This grand city boasts an indescribable je ne sais quoi that is sure to inspire an incredibly romantic honeymoon."
